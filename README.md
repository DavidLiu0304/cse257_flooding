# flooding
Demo code for the flooding regularizer proposed in "[Do We Need Zero Training Loss After Achieving Zero Training Error?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08709)" by Takashi Ishida, Ikko Yamane, Tomoya Sakai, Gang Niu, and Masashi Sugiyama.

## Requirements
- pytorch 1.3.1
- mlflow 1.5.0

## Demo
Run the following demo for a simple demonstration of flooding with synthetic datasets.  See the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.08709) for the details of the synthetic datasets.

```bash
python run_demo_synth.py
```

You will expect to see two png files saved in your directory which is a visualization of the results.
